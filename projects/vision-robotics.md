## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This robotic arm was **designed and built from scratch**, including:

- Custom-designed mechanical links and joints
- Precision stepper control with kinematic modeling
- Vision-based object detection and pick & place
- Controlled using Python + ROS + microcontroller firmware

It integrates:
- ðŸŽ¯ Real-time feedback from vision sensors
- ðŸ“¦ Modular control architecture
- ðŸ“¡ Remote operation via ROS2 (optional)
