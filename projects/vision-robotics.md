This custom 6 Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF) robotic arm was fully designed and developed in-house â€” from **mechanical CAD** and **control electronics** to **software integration**.

### Key Features:

- **6-axis articulated arm** with fully custom mechanical links
- Real-time **vision-guided manipulation**
- Runs **ROS** on **NVIDIA Jetson Nano** for on-board compute
- **CAN bus** communication to interface motor controllers
